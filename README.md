This repository mainly stores mechanical fault diagnosis codes based on deep learning, including the following stages: data preprocessing, building deep learning model training, validation, and visualization. 
The data preprocessing converts the original vibration signals into one-dimensional original signals and different types of two-dimensional image signals as model inputs. 
The network model includes one-dimensional and two-dimensional deep learning models, 
and visualization validation includes loss maps The visualization results of TSNE features, classification confusion matrix, and some parts still need further improvement due to time constraints.
